    "Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2): Bootstrap confidence intervals \n",
    "\n",
    "This is Chapter 2.  You shouldn't need Chapter 1, but you are welcome to do it.  If this chapter interests you, then you might get something out of completing Chapters 3 and 4 as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce the \"trace\" plot for the clear/cloudy day problem from Inference2.ipynb.  Then plot the histogram of that trace, throwing away steps in the trace that could be considered part of the burn-in.  Your plots should look like the ones from class (or nicer!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Do you get (essentially) the same answer for day $N$ as day $N+1$?\n",
    "* Does it matter whether is was clear or cloudy on the day that you started? \n",
    "* What length \"burn in\" would you recommend for this process?\n",
    "\n",
    "See starter code below.  You don't **have** to use it (e.g., if you have a different way to approach/code the problem), but it should help you get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy over all the code cells from our interactive MCMC example in Inference2 (7 cells in all from the cell that imports numpy to the histogram of the chain).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Change the code so that the likelihood plot is drawn in purple instead of green or red when the odds ratio for the next model is not favored, but is still larger than the random value used for the \"accept\" threshold.  So, now you will have green plots for steps that are both better and accepted, purple for steps that aren't better but are still accepted, and red for steps that are not accepted.  Also change the code so that the step size is small enough that you are likely to take a long time to reach the most likely value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done both of those things, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run enough steps to show 2 steps that were accepted, even though they are worse.\n",
    "* Plot the chain showing it taking some time to get from the initial value to oscillating around the most likely value.\n",
    "* Plot a histogram of the chain both using the full chain and after throwing away the \"burn\" period."
